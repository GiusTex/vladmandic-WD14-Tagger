Tagger for [Automatic1111's WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)
---
Interrogate booru style tags for single or multiple image files using various models, such as DeepDanbooru.

## Disclaimer
I didn't make any models, and most of the code was heavily borrowed from the [DeepDanbooru](https://github.com/KichangKim/DeepDanbooru) and MrSmillingWolf's tagger.

## Installation
1. New, clean installation:
   - go to *Extensions* -> *Install from URL* -> Enter URL of this repository -> Press *Install* button. When you see it's been installed, close the command console and run again it.
   - or clone this repository under `extensions/`
      ```sh
      $ git clone https://github.com/GiusTex/vladmandic-WD14-Tagger.git extensions/vladmandic-WD14-Tagger
      ```
2. Fix already installed automatic1111-wd14-tagger extension:
   - move the extension from automatic1111>extensions folder to VladDiffusion>extensions folder.
   - delete vladmandic-wd14-tagger>preload.py and change it with the preload.py from my repo, delete vladmandic-wd14-tagger>tagger>utils.py and ui.py, and change them with utils.py and ui.py from my repo.

3. *(optional)* Add interrogate model
   - #### *DeepDanbooru*
      1. Various model files can be found below.
         - [DeepDanbooru models](https://github.com/KichangKim/DeepDanbooru/releases)

            *(link contains NSFW contents!)*

      1. Move the project folder containing the model and config to `models/deepdanbooru`

      1. The file structure should look like:
         ```
         models/
         └╴deepdanbooru/
           ├╴deepdanbooru-v3-20211112-sgd-e28/
           │ ├╴project.json
           │ └╴...
           │
           ├╴deepdanbooru-v4-20200814-sgd-e30/
           │ ├╴project.json
           │ └╴...
           │
           ├╴e621-v3-20221117-sgd-e32/
           │ ├╴project.json
           │ └╴...
           │
           ...
         ```

1. Start or restart the WebUI.
   - or you can press refresh button after *Interrogator* dropdown box.
   - "You must close stable diffusion completely after installation and re-run it!"
